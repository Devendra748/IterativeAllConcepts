# Iterative All Concepts
This README provides instructions and examples for using the OpenAI Chatbot to generate product descriptions based on technical specifications. The chatbot utilizes the OpenAI API and the GPT-3.5-turbo model.

#  Getting Started
To use the OpenAI Chatbot, follow these steps:

Install the OpenAI Python package by running the following command:

```
pip install openai
```
Import the OpenAI package and set your API key:

```
import openai
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key.

#  Usage
The get_completion function in the code allows you to generate responses from the chatbot. It takes a prompt as input and returns the generated response.

Here's an example of how to generate a product description:

```
fact_sheet_chair = """
... Technical specifications ...
"""

prompt = f"""
Your task is to help a marketing team create a 
description for a retail website of a product based 
on a technical fact sheet.

Write a product description based on the information 
provided in the technical specifications delimited by 
triple backticks.

Technical specifications: ```{fact_sheet_chair}```
"""

response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
Make sure to replace ... Technical specifications ... with the actual technical specifications of the product.

#  Examples
The code provided includes several examples demonstrating different use cases of the chatbot. These examples generate product descriptions based on the provided technical specifications. You can modify and adapt these examples to suit your specific requirements.

#  Important Note
Keep in mind that the results produced by the chatbot may vary depending on the version of the language model you are using. It is recommended to experiment and evaluate the generated responses to ensure they meet your expectations.
